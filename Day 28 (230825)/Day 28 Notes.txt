Day 28 Notes

Unix/Linux
==========
Basic Commands
--------------
List of Windows Command Prompt (DOS) commands to perform different tasks:

=> Navigate to a Directory: 

Start by opening the Command Prompt. Use the `cd` command to navigate to a directory on your computer, for example, navigate to your Documents folder:
   
   from c: to d: => d:
   
   use cd command to navigate to any directory
   
   cd folder-name

=> Create a Directory: Create a new directory called "Folder1" using the `mkdir` command:
   
   mkdir folder1

=> List Directory Contents: Use the `dir` command to list the contents of the current directory. Ensure that the "Folder1" directory is listed.
   
   dir
   
   move inside folder 1 => cd folder1

=> Create Text Files: Create two text files named "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" using the `echo` command:

   echo This is the content of file 1. > file1.txt
   echo This is the content of file 2. > file2.txt
   
=> Display File Contents: Use the `type` command to display the contents of "file1.txt":
   
   type file1.txt

=> Create a new folder : folder2 inside folder1

=> Copy Files: Use the `copy` command to make a copy of "file1.txt" into the "folder2" directory:
   
   copy file1.txt folder2\

=> Rename file

   move file2.txt file3.txt

=> Move Files: Use the `move` command to move "file3.txt" into the "folder2" directory:
   
   move file3.txt folder2\

=> List Directory Contents Again: Use the `dir` command to confirm that the files were copied and moved correctly to the "Folder1" directory:
   
   dir
   
   to see the content of folder2=> dir folder2

=> Clean Up: Finally, delete the "Folder1" directory and its contents using the `rmdir` command:

    rmdir /s /q Folder1

System config
-------------
=> Display IP Configuration: Use the `ipconfig` command to display information about your computer's network interfaces:

   ipconfig   

=> Display System Information: Use the `systeminfo` command to display detailed system information:
    
    systeminfo
	
=> Ping a Host: Choose a host (e.g., "www.google.com") and use the `ping` command to send a few ICMP echo requests to it:

    ping www.google.com
    
=> Display Running Processes: Use the `tasklist` command to display a list of running processes:
    
    tasklist
    
Task, Process Id and Port
=========================
1. Check whether port 8080 is running:

=> netstat -ano | findstr "8080"

Probable result:

TCP  0.0.0.0:8080  0.0.0.0:0  LISTENING  484
.
TCP  127.0.0.1:55146  127.0.0.1:8080  ESTABLISHED 10956
.

484 and 10956 are Process IDs (PID)

2. Find out the name of the process running on these ports/pids

=> tasklist /FI "PID eq 484"
=> tasklist /FI "PID eq 10956"

Probable result:

Image Name   PID
javaw.exe    484
eclipse.exe  10956

We can see that PID 484 corresponds to javaw.exe process.

Tomcat is a Java-based web server and it runs Java applications using the `javaw.exe` process.

When you run a Java application like Tomcat, it starts a `javaw.exe` process in the background to manage and execute the Java code. This is a common behavior for Java-based applications on Windows.

3. Kill the process

=> taskkill /F /PID <PID>
=> taskkill /F /PID 484
