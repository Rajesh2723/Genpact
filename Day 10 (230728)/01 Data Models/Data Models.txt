Data Models
===========
What are Data Models?

> Data Models is a collection of concepts to describe the structure of a database

> Most data models also include a set of basic operations for specifying data retrieval and data updation

What are the different categories of Data Models?

There are 3 categories of data models:

1. High level or conceptual data model
2. Representational or implementational data model
3. Low level or pysical data model

High level data model
---------------------
> High level data model or conceptual data model provide concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data
> Using this, even a person without technical knowledge can understand data storage
> It uses concepts like entity relation and attributes to describe the data model

Representational data model
---------------------------
> Representational data model or the implementational data model shows how actually the data will be stored

> Its hides the details of data storage disc but is implemented on a computer directly

Types of Data Models
--------------------
1. Entity Relationship model (E-R diagram) - High Level
2. Relational data model - Representational
3. Hierarchical Model - Representational
4. Network model - Representational

Entity Relationship model
--------------------------
> It is a type of high level data model
> In entity relation data model, an entity represents a real world object or concepts such as an employee or a student
> Every entity has its characteristics, which are represented as attributes
> The connection between different entities are representd with relations

Explanation-Entity, Entity Type, Entity set
--------------------------------------------
// Type  <actual object>
Student s1 = new Student();
Entity -> s1
Entity Type -> Student
Student s2;
Student s3;
Student s4;

Group of s1, s2, s3, etc -> Entity Set

Relational data model
---------------------
> It is a type of Representational data model
> Relational data model uses the concepts of database as a collection of tables, where each table can be stored separately as a file
> All the db operations are done with relations between the tables
> Most relational databases use high level language like SQL
 
Hierarchical Model
------------------
> It is a type of Representational data model
> It organises data in a tree like structure 
> Lets say we have a company and that company has multiple departments. Each department has multiple employees
> Now one important factor is that each child node will have a single parent node

Network model
-------------
> It is a type of Representational data model
> It is a like a graph but here one child node can have multiple parent nodes

Low Level Data Model
--------------------
> Low Level Data Model or physical data model dscribes how the data is stored on the physical storage
> It is not for common end user
> It is for more knowledgeable persons
