Page Redirection
----------------
In Spring MVC, page redirection is a common technique used to navigate users from one URL to another. 
This can be achieved using various approaches and annotations. 

1. RedirectView Class
- The RedirectView class in Spring MVC allows us to create a redirection view. 
- We can use this class to specify the target URL to which the user should be redirected.

2. Redirect Prefix: 
- In Spring MVC, you can use the redirect: prefix in the view name to indicate that the request should be redirected to a different URL. 
- For example, redirect:/newPage would redirect the user to the "newPage" URL.

3. RedirectAttributes: 
- When performing a redirect, you might want to pass data between the current request and the redirected request. 
RedirectAttributes can be used to add attributes that will be automatically transferred to the redirected URL as query parameters.
