Spring
======
Spring is a Dependency Injection tool used to create loosely coupled applications.

Spring is an Inversion of Control tool used to create loosely coupled applications.

Loosely coupled 
Tightly coupled 
Dependency Injection (DI)
Inversion of Control (IOC)

Spring Core
===========
Dependency Injection:
There are 2 ways of injecting dependencies:
1. Property/Setter Injection
2. Constructor Injection

public class MyService {
    private MyDependency myDependency;

    // Setter method for dependency injection
    public void setMyDependency(MyDependency myDependency) {
        this.myDependency = myDependency;
    }

    // Other methods of MyService that use myDependency
}

// Configuration in Spring context file (XML configuration)
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService">
    <property name="myDependency" ref="myDependencyBean"/>
</bean>

<bean id="myDependencyBean" class="com.example.MyDependency"/>

public class MyService {
    private MyDependency myDependency;

    // Constructor for dependency injection
    public MyService(MyDependency myDependency) {
        this.myDependency = myDependency;
    }

    // Other methods of MyService that use myDependency
}

// Configuration in Spring context file (XML configuration)
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService">
    <constructor-arg ref="myDependencyBean"/>
</bean>

<bean id="myDependencyBean" class="com.example.MyDependency"/>

Autowiring

Spring Web MVC
==============
- It is a sub module of Spring Framework
- Its main task is to create Web Application using Spring
- We can integrate Jdbc and Hibernate with Spring Web MVC

Spring Boot
===========
- It is a sub module of Spring Framework
- It is used of Rapid Application Development
- Mainly used for implementing Web Services (SOAP/Restful)
- To create microservices
