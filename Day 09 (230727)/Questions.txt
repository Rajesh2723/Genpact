Training on Java is going on. 

There are 2 batches: Core Java Batch and Advanced Java Batch, both have 5 students each. 

Now these batches have to be merged for Data Structures batch. 

Some students donâ€™t want to continue, so we have to remove them.  

There are 2 students with same name, duplicate values must be preserved. 

Finally the batch is over and we have to clear the data.

Problem Statement 2:

We have to keep a record of employees for a company. 

The employees have an empId, department, salary and date of joining.

Also, employees leave and new ones join the company. 

It is festival time and company has decided festival bonus based on years of service. 

Employees with 3+ years will receive 50% and employees with less than 3 years will receive 25% of their salaries in incentives. 

So we have to calculate their total salaries.
